  "dry_escape_title": "Drought-Resistant Plants",
  "dry_escape_titleDescription": "A vibrant garden using plants that survive with little water.\nIt supports biodiversity and shows how low-water landscapes can be lush.",
  "dry_escape_descriptions_0": "The concept is “Greening with Less Water,” focusing on the use of drought-resistant (or drought-tolerant) plants that can thrive with minimal water. These plants are ideal for water-scarce regions, climate-resilient landscaping, and sustainable farming, making them a smart and sustainable choice for future-ready green spaces.",
  "dry_escape_descriptions_1": "To implement this idea, a variety of drought-tolerant species were introduced. These include succulents like Aloe vera, Sedum, and Agave; native grasses such as Vetiver and Fountain Grass; flowering shrubs like Bougainvillea and Lantana; and hardy herbs including Rosemary, Thyme, and Lemongrass. All of these plants were selected for their ability to survive in harsh, dry conditions with very little irrigation.",
  "dry_escape_descriptions_2": "These drought-tolerant plants help save water by requiring minimal irrigation and are low maintenance due to their natural adaptability. They also contribute to soil protection by preventing erosion and improving soil structure. Additionally, they support biodiversity by attracting pollinators and native wildlife, and enhance climate resilience by thriving in areas facing erratic rainfall and the effects of climate change.",

  "fruit_orchard_title": "Native Fruit Trees",
  "fruit_orchard_titleDescription": "A diverse orchard with local trees offering shade, clean air, fresh fruits, and educational value.",
  "fruit_orchard_descriptions_0": "You can see Chikoo trees (sapodilla), Shahtoot (Morus), Anjerr Fig (Ficus carica), Curry Pata (Murraya koenigii), Mango (Mangifera indica), and Citrus. These trees offer multiple environmental, nutritional, economic, cultural, and climate resilience benefits, making them a valuable addition to the landscape.",
  "fruit_orchard_descriptions_1": "The plantation offers key environmental benefits by purifying air, preventing soil erosion, and aiding groundwater recharge. Native trees also boost biodiversity by supporting birds and pollinators. Health-wise, they provide seasonal, chemical-free fruits with higher nutrient value, promoting food security. Economically, these low-maintenance, climate-adapted trees reduce costs and can generate income through surplus fruit sales.",
  "fruit_orchard_descriptions_2": "Culturally and educationally, these trees help preserve traditional and heirloom varieties and serve as a practical tool for learning about ecology, sustainability, and agriculture. They also foster community engagement by encouraging shared responsibility and care. In terms of climate resilience, local tree varieties are naturally drought-tolerant, require less water, and are resistant to local pests, minimizing the need for harmful pesticides and making them ideal for sustainable urban environments.",

  "upcycled_furniture_title": "Upcycled Furniture",
  "upcycled_furniture_titleDescription":"Chairs and tables made from old tyres, wood, and plastic waste. They’re strong, colorful, and tell a story of sustainability.",
  "upcycled_furniture_descriptions_0":"The concept revolves around creating a garden table and chair set from waste materials, particularly old tyres. This is a clear example of reuse—repurposing an item without altering its original form. Instead of breaking down the tyres into raw materials, they are creatively transformed into functional furniture pieces, promoting sustainability through innovative design.",
  "upcycled_furniture_descriptions_1": "Old tyres, which are non-biodegradable and hard to dispose of, were repurposed to reduce landfill waste and support sustainable living. This contributes to the circular economy by giving waste a new life. Tyres are low-cost or free, making tyre furniture affordable and a potential source of income through sales. The process also promotes skill development and raises awareness about recycling, especially in educational and community projects.",
  "upcycled_furniture_descriptions_2": "The project combines aesthetics, function, and social value. Tyre furniture can be uniquely styled to match garden themes and is durable for outdoor use. These reused tyres serve as chairs, stools, tables, or planters. They also support community clean-up and art projects, while engaging youth or unemployed individuals in meaningful work through social enterprise initiatives.",

Broken tile mosaics enhance its aesthetic charm, while lab-tested cubes and cylinders ensure structural stability. It serves multiple purposes—ideal for discussions, study, or relaxation—and blends naturally into green spaces with minimal environmental impact.",
  "meeting_area_descriptions_1": "The result is a unique platform measuring 14.5 ft by 9.5 ft and 0.75 ft in heightThis initiative promotes sustainability by diverting construction and lab waste from landfills. It stays cost-efficient through the use of free or low-cost reclaimed materials. With no new production, it saves energy and lowers embodied carbon. The weather-resistant materials also ensure long-term durability.",
  "meeting_area_descriptions_2": "After casting the platform, a comparison of cost, energy, and carbon footprint was made. The cost using new materials was Rs. 40,275/-, while recycled materials reduced it to Rs. 8,708/-. Energy consumption for new materials was 69,280 Btu, whereas none was used with recycled materials. The carbon footprint was 902 kg CO₂ eq for new materials and 187 kg CO₂ eq for recycled ones.",
